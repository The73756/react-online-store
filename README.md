# Online store on PERN stack

This is a fully functional application with React, Express, Node and Postgres. This is a small e-commerce application that allows users to view products, add them to the cart and rate them, and you can also choose different configurations of the product.

## Implemented:

- Cart with saving the configuration of the device
- Registration and authorization using JWT
- Rating system
- Small but fully functional admin panel
- Pagination, search, sorting
- Preloaders

## Stack:

### Client

- ReactJS 18 + Hooks
- React Router 6
- MobX
- SCSS + CSS modules
- Axios
- Swiper
- React loading skeleton + react content loader

### Server

- Express
- Sequelize
- JWT
- PostgreSQL 14
- Node Js 16.15.1

## Flaws:

- Design - i am a bad designer
- Architecture - I have little experience in the development of large projects, besides I did not use any methodology

## How to run:

1. change the configuration for your database in server/.env
2. npm install (server + client)
3. npm run dev - start server
4. npm start - start client
